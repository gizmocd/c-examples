# cpp-examples

This is a collection of programs I have recently created in C++ using a macintosh laptop and g++.

newton.cpp: This program utilizes Newton's method, a numerical method of finding roots, to find a root of a function (the function does not find multiple roots). The function is specified as f(x) = x^2 - 5 in the program, but can easily be modified. The program requires user inputs for the first x value at which to begin the approximation and for the depth of the recurive function. 

simple_data_structs.cpp: This program is a problem (admittedly labelled as easy) for hackerearth.com (https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/stacks/basics-of-stacks/practice-problems/algorithm/monk-and-philosophers-stone/). The program involves basic data structure usage. I utilized the stack and queue structures from the standard template library for this problem. The problem was simple by utilizing a LIFO (stack) structure and a FIFO (queue) structure.
