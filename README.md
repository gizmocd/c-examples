# cpp-examples

This is a collection of programs I have recently created in C++ using a macintosh laptop and g++.

newton.cpp: This program utilizes Newton's method, a numerical method of finding roots, to find a root of a function (the function does not find multiple roots). The function is specified as f(x) = x^2 - 5 in the program, but can easily be modified. The program requires user inputs for the first x value at which to begin the approximation and for the depth of the recurive function.
